## Overview
```bash
This consists of dual-head neural network capable of unmixing overlapping audio signals while simultaneously identifying their semantic classes. Utilizing a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) backbone and Permutation Invariant Training (PIT), we achieve state-of-the-art results on the ESC-50 dataset. The system demonstrates a peak accuracy of 90% with an average accuracy of 70% on 2-source mixtures, validating the efficacy of our mask-based spectral filtering approach.

## Introduction
```bash
An attempt to address the cocktail party problem--focusing on a single auditory source in a noisy environment—remains a pinnacle challenge in machine perception.

----
## How to run
```bash
1.Run downloader.ipynb first to load the dataset
2.Check the dataset paths in the main.ipynb
3.Enjoy and let it train
```
----
## Website
```bash
Running the second cell of main.ipynb after the training does give you a website with public url- will only stay active as long as 
notebook is active- features a very simple website for showcase
```
